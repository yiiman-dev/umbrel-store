  Expose your apps to the internet easily and securely.


  ⚠️ Be cautious when exposing apps to the public internet. Ensure they have proper security, such as login protection, and avoid exposing sensitive apps without adequate safeguards.
  

  🔧 Safe line uses port 50080 for HTTP (unsecured) traffic and port 50443 for HTTPS (secured) traffic.
  To make your apps accessible from the public internet, you will need to set up port forwarding on your router.
  Forward external port 80 (HTTP) to internal port 50080 and external port 443 (HTTPS) to internal port 50443.
  Your SafeLine admin panel will be private on your network and exposed on port 50081
